# handbook-node

Server/backend built in Node w/ Express, for the handbook frontend.

## ðŸš§ This is a dev project ðŸš§

This is a project to explore examples of coding, not necessarily the best practices for a production environment. We will work to document pitfalls/tradeoffs, but do think of this as a sandbox and not as a production ready application.

## Open to Contributors

This is a project for learning/exploring a node express backend. There will be code duplication, redundant use of databases and other technology to further understanding of how things can/will work through examples. That said definitely jump in with tips/tricks/ideas for improvement either here via issues or via dm to @explorejs on twitter or in our community. Happy Coding.

## Databases

Discussing as a group what people want to see examples of, potentially:

- [FaunaDB](https://fauna.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
